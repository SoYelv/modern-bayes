# Suggested Readings

## Hoff

I suggest that you read all of Hoff and you will be expected to have read the readings that correspond with the notes before 
coming to class. There are also notes that I have written under readings/ that you may find helping as additional resources. 

## Required Material

Before starting the course for the fall semester, I would highly recommend review the pre-req material for the course on the [syllabus](https://github.com/resteorts/modern-bayes/blob/master/syllabus/syllabus-sta360-fall20.pdf). Given the shortened semester, please make sure that you are 100 percent comfortable with the pre-req material before taking STA 360. If you have any questions regarding this, please reach out to me as soon as possible.
