Total points: 3 (reproducibility) + 15 (Q1) + 25 (Q2) = 50 points.\

\begin{enumerate}
\item (15 points, 5 points each) Hoff, 3.12 (Jeffrey's prior).

Jeffrey's (1961) suggested a default rule for generating a prior distribution of a parameter $\theta$ in a sampling model $p(y \mid \theta).$ Jeffreys' prior is given by 
$$p_J(\theta) \propto \sqrt{I(\theta)},$$
where $$I(\theta) = - E\left[
\frac{\partial^2 \log p(Y \mid \theta)}{\partial \theta^2}
\mid \theta \right]
$$ is the Fisher information. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $Y \sim \text{Binomial}(n,\theta).$ Show that $p_J(\theta) \propto Beta(1/2,1/2).$
\item Re-parameterize the model in part a such that $\psi= \log[\theta/(1-\theta)].$ This implies that $p(y \mid \psi) = 
{n \choose y} e^{\psi y} (1 + e^{\psi})^{-n}.$ Show that 
$$p_J(\psi) \propto \frac{n^{1/2}e^{\psi/2}}{1+ e^{\psi}} \propto \frac{e^{\psi/2}}{1+ e^{\psi}}.$$
\item Take the prior distribution from (a) and apply the change of variables formula from exercise 3.10 (see Homework 4) to obtain the induced prior density on $\psi.$ This density should be the same as the one derived in part b) of this exercise. This consistency under re-parametrization is the defining characteristic of Jeffereys' prior. 
\end{enumerate}
